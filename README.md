# LIS598ThesaurusViewer
## Preface
The goal of my LIS598 Project was to experiment whether I can build an interface with extremely limited knowledge of javascript and html using generative AI. The short answer is Yes. In the Project Documentation folder,
I documented my journey of how I transformed the Thesaurus Viewer from a design concep map into a working interface.<br>

I wanted to put myself in the shoes of librarians or other professionals in the GLAM sector who don't have extensive programming knowledge and don't have the resources to invest in either hiring programmers or learning the basics in months. I want to explore how we can utilize generative AI to build a project based on our design and vision in a short amount of time. For me, it was a little over a month. 

Feel free to copy, modify, and clone it to your repository.

## How to use the ThesaurusViewer
* The ThesaurusViewer is separated into two parts: the details panel and the hierarchical list. 
* To replace the dataset with your own, simply upload your thesaurus in the dataset and replace the corresponding link in the script. You can also use a more user-friendly styling sheet by replacing the current one with the one titled "regularstyle.css".
* To structure your data so that the script can process, please see the instruction in datasets folder.
* [CLICK HERE](https://dchen077.github.io/LIS598ThesaurusViewer/) to access the viewer.<br>

All of these will be annotated in the index.html script. 

## Ethics of AI Statement
I would like to acknowledge that I am acutely aware of the many ethical concerns of generative AI and agree with the critiques of its environmental, social, and political impact. Nevertheless, any tool, generative AI or not, has the potential to do good and bad. The key lies in the intention behind its use. Generative AI can be used for good when we can scrutinize its answers and at the same time utilize it to help us build something that we previously can't or don't have the resources to do. Therefore, I would also like to advocate for AI literacy to better understand this tool that won't be going away for any time soon.
