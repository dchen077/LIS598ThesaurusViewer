**The following information explains where each dataset comes from.**
  
  Tinysample.csv is a tiny dataset I made up on the go to test the script.
  
  Transportation.csv took one facet from the [Transportation Research Thesaurus](https://trt.trb.org/term/90593). Its download function was broken so I am currently populating the csv file myself. It is a bigger dataset than Tinysample as I want to make sure my script works on more than one dataset.
