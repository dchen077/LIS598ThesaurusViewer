**The following information explains where each dataset comes from.**
  
  Tinysample.csv is a tiny dataset I made up on the go to test the script.
  
  Transportation.csv took a few facets from the [Transportation Research Thesaurus](https://trt.trb.org/term/90593). Its download function was broken so I am currently populating the csv file myself. It is a bigger dataset than Tinysample as I want to make sure my script works on more than one dataset.

  coffe.csv is the modified version (though no content is taken out) of what my group created during LIS537! Shoutout to my teammates~
